# Rainfall_Pred
This project predicts rainfall using a deep neural network built with PyTorch. It involves preprocessing weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind), training a custom neural model with BCE and AUC-based loss optimization, and generating predictions on unseen test data. The goal is to improve rainfall forecasting using machine learning.
